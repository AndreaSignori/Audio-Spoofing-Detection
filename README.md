# Audio-Spoofing-Detection
This project contains code that is used to create a classifier that is able to distinguish between spoofed audio and bonafide one.

Dataset used is ASVspoof2019 Logical Access dataset. 20 Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients were extracted from each audio file and passed as a dataset for purposes of Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms.
